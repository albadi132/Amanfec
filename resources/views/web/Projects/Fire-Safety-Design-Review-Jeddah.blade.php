            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Design Stage Review of Fire and Life Safety Systems</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              Our fire protection experts carried out a detailed review of the initial design documents and technical plans, covering the following components:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li><strong>Fire Suppression Systems:</strong> Reviewed system coverage, selected technologies, and integration with building services to ensure effective fire control and extinguishment.</li>
              <li><strong>Fire Alarm and Voice Communication Systems:</strong> Evaluated alarm layouts and specifications to confirm they deliver fast, clear, and reliable emergency notifications.</li>
              <li><strong>Evacuation Systems:</strong> Assessed egress paths, exits, and overall emergency evacuation strategy to ensure safe occupant movement in crisis scenarios.</li>
              <li><strong>Life Safety and Passive Fire Barrier Systems:</strong> Analyzed passive protection elements such as fire-rated walls, doors, and barriers designed to contain fire spread and safeguard critical infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Project Outcome</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              Our design review led to significant safety enhancements, with targeted recommendations that improved system effectiveness and regulatory alignment. The input provided ensured a smoother transition to the next design phase and reinforced the project's commitment to occupant safety and code compliance.
