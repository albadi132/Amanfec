            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              This large-scale development in AlUla required a full-scope approach to fire protection, including design reviews, construction administration, and advanced modeling services. The objective was to deliver a compliant and high-performing fire and life safety system from planning through commissioning.
            </p>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">1. Fire and Life Safety System Design Review (Design Stage)</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              Our team performed a detailed assessment of the submitted designs, ensuring compliance with safety standards and functional integration:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li><strong>Fire Suppression Systems:</strong> Reviewed system design for adequate fire control coverage and integration.</li>
              <li><strong>Fire Alarm and Voice Systems:</strong> Assessed notification layouts for clarity, coverage, and emergency effectiveness.</li>
              <li><strong>Evacuation Systems:</strong> Evaluated exit strategies and travel paths to ensure safe occupant egress.</li>
              <li><strong>Life Safety and Passive Fire Barrier Systems:</strong> Verified structural containment solutions and fire-resistant materials.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">2. Construction Administration</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              During construction, we provided critical oversight to support the successful implementation and testing of fire protection systems:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Coordinated on-site system testing and commissioning activities.</li>
              <li>Supervised acceptance testing to validate system readiness and functionality.</li>
              <li>Assisted with securing final engineer approvals and Civil Defense certifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">3. Smoke Control Design and CFD/Fire Modeling</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              We utilized advanced engineering tools to support the development of effective smoke management solutions:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Designed optimized smoke control systems tailored to the project architecture.</li>
              <li>Conducted CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations to predict smoke behavior and inform system design.</li>
              <li>Applied fire modeling to validate performance-based strategies and ensure code compliance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Project Outcome</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              The combination of robust design reviews, expert construction support, and intelligent fire modeling contributed to the delivery of a fully compliant fire and life safety system. Our CFD analysis provided critical insights for smoke control optimization, enhancing occupant protection and accelerating regulatory approvals.
