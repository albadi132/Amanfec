            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Fire and Life Safety System Design Review (Design Stage)</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              During the initial design stage, we provided comprehensive reviews for the following system components:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li><strong>Fire Suppression Systems:</strong> Assessed system type, design coverage, and compatibility with overall protection strategies.</li>
              <li><strong>Fire Alarm and Voice Communication Systems:</strong> Evaluated alert mechanisms and layout for timely and effective communication.</li>
              <li><strong>Evacuation Systems:</strong> Reviewed egress paths and layouts to ensure safe and efficient evacuation for occupants.</li>
              <li><strong>Life Safety and Passive Fire Barrier Systems:</strong> Verified proper materials and configurations to contain fire and protect critical areas.</li>
              <li><strong>Smoke Control Systems:</strong> Checked ventilation design for effective smoke removal during emergencies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Fire and Life Safety System Design Review (Detailed Design Stage)</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              In the detailed design phase, we examined all technical documentation and final layouts, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Detailed layouts for fire alarm and notification systems.</li>
              <li>Firefighting and safety equipment placement drawings.</li>
              <li>Life safety design drawings reflecting full compliance with codes.</li>
              <li>Hydraulic and system performance calculations.</li>
              <li>Material submittals assessed for adherence to standards and specifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Construction Administration</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              Throughout the construction stage, we provided on-site technical support to oversee system installation and ensure regulatory compliance:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Provided assistance during testing and commissioning to resolve issues in real time.</li>
              <li>Managed acceptance testing procedures to validate full system readiness.</li>
              <li>Handled documentation and inspections for final engineer’s and Civil Defense approvals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Project Outcome</h4>
