            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              This large-scale development project in Makkah required full-scope fire and life safety (FLS) management, from preliminary design through detailed planning and into construction administration. The objective was to implement an integrated and fully compliant FLS system that aligned with stringent safety codes and operational excellence.
            </p>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">1. Preliminary Design (PD) Stage – FLS System</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              At the preliminary stage, foundational elements of the fire safety infrastructure were defined and evaluated, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li><strong>Suppression and Sprinkler Systems:</strong> Developed initial strategies for active fire control.</li>
              <li><strong>Standpipe Systems, Fire Mains, Hydrants, and Pumps:</strong> Defined key firefighting infrastructure layouts.</li>
              <li><strong>Detection and Notification Systems:</strong> Planned fire alarm control panels, notification appliances, and operational sequences.</li>
              <li><strong>Smoke Detector and Manual Call Point Placement:</strong> Strategically distributed for early hazard detection.</li>
              <li><strong>Fire and Smoke Barriers:</strong> Defined fire rating requirements based on occupancy and functional use.</li>
              <li><strong>Egress and Occupant Safety:</strong> Assessed occupant loads, exit capacity, emergency lighting, and access routes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">2. Detailed Design Stage – FLS System</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              This phase focused on refining system components to ensure complete compliance and technical integrity:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Finalized suppression and sprinkler system specifications and layouts.</li>
              <li>Produced detailed drawings for standpipes, hydrants, and pump systems.</li>
              <li>Engineered functional detection and alarm systems, including control panels and notification logic.</li>
              <li>Verified detector placement for optimized coverage and response time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">3. Construction Administration Stage – FLS System</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              During construction, we ensured quality execution and code adherence through:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Reviewing shop and IFC drawings for fire protection and detection systems.</li>
              <li>Verifying that contractor submittals covered all FLS components accurately.</li>
              <li>Inspecting material submittals for compliance with technical specifications.</li>
              <li>Witnessing installation, testing, and commissioning processes on-site.</li>
              <li>Compiling final documentation and coordinating with Civil Defense for occupancy approval.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Project Outcome</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              The comprehensive approach across all stages of the project ensured delivery of a robust and compliant fire and life safety system. The detailed planning and oversight resulted in successful Civil Defense approval, safe conditions for occupancy, and seamless handover to stakeholders.
