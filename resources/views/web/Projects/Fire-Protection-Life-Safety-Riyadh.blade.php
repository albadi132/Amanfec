            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              This project involved comprehensive fire protection and life safety management during the construction of a major facility in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Given the critical operational periods—including Ramadan and Hajj seasons—our team ensured full regulatory compliance and safety readiness at every stage of the construction lifecycle.

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Supervision of Daily Construction Activities for Temporary Systems</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              We managed and supervised daily on-site activities concerning temporary fire protection and life safety systems. Our scope included the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Preparation of detailed staff, equipment, and documentation readiness reports to ensure compliance.</li>
              <li>Execution of Fire Risk Assessments, particularly during Ramadan and Hajj seasons.</li>
              <li>Development and implementation of safety KPIs and performance monitoring procedures.</li>
              <li>Formulation of Fire Protection Management Plans for both construction and high-traffic periods.</li>

            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Fire Suppression System specifications and layout.</li>
              <li>Fire Alarm and Voice Communication system compliance and integration.</li>
              <li>Evacuation planning and egress analysis for safe occupant flow.</li>
              <li>Life Safety and Passive Fire Protection systems for fire containment.</li>
              <li>Smoke Control Systems for efficient hazard mitigation and visibility preservation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Design Review – Detailed Stage</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              At the detailed design phase, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of submitted documents, including:

            <ul class="blog-details__text-2">
              <li>Fire Alarm & Notification system layout drawings.</li>
              <li>Firefighting and fire safety equipment distribution plans.</li>
              <li>Detailed life safety plans covering all building zones.</li>
              <li>Technical calculations confirming system capacity and coverage.</li>
              <li>Material submittals assessed against project specifications and code requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="blog-details__subtitle mt-4">Construction Administration and On-Site Support</h4>
            <p class="blog-details__text-2">
              Our support extended through construction with an active presence to ensure that system installation and performance aligned with safety expectations:
